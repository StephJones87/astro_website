> _This blog post was originally written in 2020._

Back in Oct 2018, I had cut my working hours to 30 hours per week (working as a clinical pharmacist — writer at the British National Formulary), and I was dedicating significant amounts of time to learning coding, listening to machine learning podcasts, and trying to navigate some sort of self-made curriculum. I had the luxury of time! However, life was about to change significantly.

In Nov 2018, my mum, who was ill with chronic fatigue and depression, became extremely acutely unwell and my priorities drastically changed overnight. I was also between 6–7 months pregnant and suddenly all of my energy was focused on helping my family to ensure round-the-clock care for my mum. I was still trying to hold down a job working and commuting to London three 12+ hour days per week, whilst also enduring frustrating phone calls to NHS mental health staff and figuring out how we could get help for my mum.

Fast forward to Dec 2018 — when my mum's health improved, thank god! Then fast forward to Jan 2019 when my son was born and I began the immersive experience of being a mum myself. The sleepless nights, the exhaustion like you have never felt before. The feeling that you wonder when you'll next surface for much-needed air!

Before having a baby, I had completed a master's while working full time, so I was sure that having a baby would not be too difficult — I was wrong. I had never appreciated how, with most things, you can put them down and have a break, or you can have a good night's sleep, or know a deadline and work to the bone until that deadline passes and then relax. One of my best friends, who works as a maxillofacial surgeon, likened having a baby to:

> _"An on-call shift that goes on indefinitely and where your bleeper is constantly going off."_

I think this is the most accurate description yet.

It was during those first months that I was still obsessed with getting a job closer to home — something, anything to do with coding. It began when I emailed Code First Girls (CFG) whilst on holiday in July 2018. I knew I wanted to get a Python coding job, but I couldn't afford the luxury of doing a poorly paid PhD because I had a mortgage and a baby to support.

CFG had stated that they ran free coding courses for girls — available to anyone out of education for less than 2 years. Bingo! Just 2 weeks before giving birth I was emailing and receiving replies from CFG — nothing like an impending birth to give you a kick up the bum.

They stated they would be running a coding course in HTML, CSS and JavaScript in Brighton, Feb 2019 to April — 2 hours per week in the evenings. I thought, “_That is my ticket!_” It was a step in the right direction.

So when my son was a month old, I left him with my partner with some pumped breast milk and headed for the Brandwatch office to learn some coding in an official capacity and figure out how to get myself a coding job based in Brighton.

This was exhilarating — as most new mums can testify, you never get alone time. It is unheard of. But here I was off to Brighton, to do some coding and make a website.

During one of the sessions I spoke to one of the instructors, and it turned out they had a data science team at Brandwatch. She suggested I could get in touch with someone on the team — which I did. We discussed some natural language processing (NLP) — something I had looked into and dabbled in on DataCamp.

I was then waiting to hear if there would be internships that year — which there were. Fantastic. So I quit my stable clinical writing pharmacist job (terrifying — hence the title of this piece, *"No Plan B"*) and interviewed for, then accepted, an internship as a Data Scientist intern at Brandwatch — which was a phenomenal experience.

My manager was fantastic. My son was only 8 months old when I started, so it was important to me not to go back full time. I was still breastfeeding and my son had been hospitalised with bronchiolitis and had allergies and eczema, so being there for him was important. I worked 10am–4pm, 3 days a week — enough time to learn and contribute, while still being present with my baby.

The days I worked were fantastic — I found a childminder who I adored and my son adored. My parents and in-laws helped on other days. And when I was at work, I was ‘Steph’ again. I got to go to the loo on my own. Make a barista-style coffee. It felt sensational — to be learning and growing in so many different ways.

I also think knowing that this would only be for 3 months helped me not feel trapped. It felt like a honeymoon period. During this time I embraced NLP, learned about data pipelines, and even suggested a project on conversation clustering to my manager. This involved extracting insights from Twitter data and using NLP, machine learning, and algorithms.

I then managed — off the back of this — to get a job in data at a company that makes a sports app. Still in Brighton, 4 days a week. Again: bingo.

In Feb 2020 I began helping to teach on the Code First Girls Python course run by Brandwatch. This continues to be a fantastic experience. I’m so passionate about teaching women to code — I know from my own experience I wasn’t interested in coding for coding’s sake. But give me a big data problem to solve, and if the solution can be coded in Python — I’m there.

I continue to love everything about Python, data, NLP and beyond.
